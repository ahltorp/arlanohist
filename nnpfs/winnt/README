BEWARE, this isn't even remotely working:

* Required tools to build (as far as I know):

 - A serial cable
 - Two computers (host and target computer)

 - Microsoft Visual Studio (really just C/C++) (6.0 + SP3)
 - Windows Platform SDK
 - Windows Customer Support Diagnostic Support CD
 - Windows DDK <http://www.microsoft.com/ddk/>
 - IFS-Kit (or GNU IFS-Kit <http://www.acc.umu.se/~bosse/ntifs.h>)
 - Some tools from OSR <http:/www.osr.com/resource_downloads.htm>
	OSR's DeviceTree Utility
	OSR Driver Loader 
	OSR's Debug Monitor
   Thanks OSR!

HOW TO HACK - a short guide
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Install everything on the host computer in the order of
  the list above. The target computer is that one you crash.
  You just need to install the "OSR Driver Loader" on that computer.

* Create directory nnpfs/winnt/src/obj/i386/checked

* Run build in nnpfs/winnt/src (or build -Z if you don't believe in
  dependencies (you don't)).

* On the target computer hack your C:\boot.ini to look that like this:

  [boot loader]
  timeout=5
  default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINNT
  [operating systems]
  multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINNT="2000" \
     /fastdetect /debug /debugport=com2 /debugrate=19200

  NOTE that the line isn't breaked in the file after the \
  It's just for readability !

  Reboot target computer

* On host computer ``run: windbg -k x86 com1 19200´´

* Copy nnpfs/winnt/src/obj/i386/checked/nnpfs.sys to 
  TARGETCOMPUTER:%Systemroot%/System32/drivers/

* Use OSR Driver Loader to load module on the target computer.

* Use "mount_nnpfs" to mount nnpfs.

* Start "arlad".

* Make it crash and fix the bugs.

* Be happy and enjoy the wonders of Windows.
